# MarginCall-Shortfall-Alert-System
An Alteryx workflow that calculates client-level margin shortfalls and triggers alerts for under-collateralized accounts.
Output Folder contain the final margin shortfall reports generated by the Alteryx workflow.
Each time the workflow runs, it filters under-collateralized clients and exports a report here in Excel or CSV format, ready for downstream use (email alerts, dashboards, escalation workflows, etc.).
